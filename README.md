## The "||" statment 


 #### Project/s we used :
            1. Calc You Later

When you create a function that takes in a parameter that can have multiple values, for expample in the picture the function calculate takes in three parameters on of them is named param. The param parameter can have a value of  '-', "minus" and "subtracted from" because we used the symbol "||". The same goes for multiply, add, divide and modulus.


# Day 1

## The While loop

#### Project/s we used :
            1. whiling away

![](/while.png)

A while loop is a "flow control system". While a condition is true  then the function will run. On the image about I have a function that prints numbers from 1 to 5. while the number greater than 0 or equal to 5 the function will run. It stops once the loop reaches 5.


#### We had a home work assignment that was a hard stretch goal called cats-cradle. Its a good to review hard assignments and test your skills to better your thought process.

# Day 2 

## For loops

![for loops demo](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RD5sE5BL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ciwuuuxvt9ew1sxd45hl.gif)


A for loop helps when looping through an array they are also helpful if you want to run the same code over again and again, each time with a different value. In the example above we have an array called numbers that has a value of a few numbers [45,78,95,36,47]
