# Or statment " || "

When you create a function that takes in a parameter that can have multiple values, for expample in the picture the function calculate takes in three parameters on of them is named param. The param parameter can have a value of  '-', "minus" and "subtracted from" because we used the symbol "||". The same goes for multiply, add, divide and modulus.
