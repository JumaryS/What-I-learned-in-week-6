When you create a function that takes in a parameter that can have multiple values, for expample in the picture the function calculate takes in three parameters on of them is named param. The param parameter can have a value of  '-', "minus" and "subtracted from" because we used the symbol "||". The same goes for multiply, add, divide and modulus.

## The While loop

#### Project/s we used :
            1. whiling away

A while loop is a "flow control system". While a condition is true  then the function will run. On the image about I have a function that prints numbers from 1 to 5. while the number greater than 0 or equal to 5 the function will run. It stops once the loop reaches 5.
